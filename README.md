# ProjectOne

The purpose of this assignment is to gain some understanding of how processes move through a computing system and to put into practice some things that you've learned in 2107 and 2168, but might not have had a chance to use in a while.

In this assignment, you'll create a discrete event simulation (Links to an external site.) in C that models the very simplified machine pictured below. The diagram shows the flow of a process through the different states in its execution history. It also shows that a process must wait to use a resource if the resource is in use or busy.
